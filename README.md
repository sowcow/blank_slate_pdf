# Overall

Permanent revolution of random pdf ideas (written with trashy non-ideomatic Rust code).

# E.pdf (/ɛ/)

[Latest link](https://sowcow.github.io/blank_slate_pdf/)

It's the latest minimalistic and abstract PDF.
The general idea is that the PDF provides ways to store records in different modes of organization,
while the exact scenarios for its use are unconstrained and are up to the user.
For that reason all pages have common header for switching between different modes.

- .: scratchpad pages, can be used for temporary content; use it by entering a random link inside the circle
- -: can be a catchall for unorganized items; it is a sequence of multiple pages (more organized items may go into squares)
- +: organization by days: 36 linked pages in a calendar-like format, configurable, predefined columns of text on every page (the default example configuration makes division into four categories of items at the corners, this can be changed/removed in configuration text fields below the button "Make E")
- ▲: organization by time period divided with checkpoints; use it by entering a link with the needed starting time and period
- ■: organization by topic/event(s); it can be seen as separate habit calendars, each having a linkink to a sequence of content pages from its header
- the circle is simply a circle

Header of every page can be set to the month name.
Also, the `+` grid is configurable so it may have experimental non-calendar uses.

# Changelog

- org-mode early inspiration but that is too open ended by itself so no 
- it started as simplistic setup that allows generation of any interactive pdfs to be filled by the user
- then enough patterns crystallized so it became more incremental and modular technically
- then actual PDFs got to be stupid-simple with least complexity introduced by them
  (PDFs went from being abstract and experimental to asbstract and simplistic. Sadly names got simpler too and there are no more names like "Square BS PDF".)
- (there was funny side effect of the project is having dreams about linked pdf grids)
- then I tried to optimize PDFs for use approaches (Bujo/PARA)
- also Days PDF got clockface and focus area
- merged other simplistic PDFs back into abstract PDF for lists (that can fit Bujo/PARA by itself);
  it is not abstract in style as early PDFs but there are no arbitrary decisions so it is true to the idea still.
- went back for asbstract for lists, went for plan/review at all scales in calendar (previously Sunday weeks version had that aspect)
- went for more geometry with hexagons
- went E
